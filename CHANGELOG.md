## 0.7.1

* Correctly map `process.on` into jsdom environments, fixes a bug introduced in
  jest 0.7.0.

## 0.7.0

* Fixed a memory leak with test contexts. Jest now properly cleans up
  test environments after each test. Added `--logHeapUsage` to log memory
  usage after each test. Note: this is option is meant for debugging memory
  leaks and might significantly slow down your test run.
* Removed `mock-modules`, `node-haste` and `mocks` virtual modules. This is a
  breaking change of undocumented public API. Usage of this API can safely be
  automatically updated through an automated codemod:
 * Example: http://astexplorer.net/#/zrybZ6UvRA
 * Codemod: https://github.com/cpojer/js-codemod/blob/master/transforms/jest-update.js
 * jscodeshift: https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift

  environment. Use `window.navigator.onLine = true;` in your test setup and
  `Object.defineProperty` instead.

## 0.6.1

* Updated jsdom to 7.0.2.
* Use the current working directory as root when passing a jest config from
  the command line.
* Updated the React examples and getting started guide
* Modules now receive a `module.parent` field so unmocked modules don't assume
  they are run directly any longer.

## 0.6.0

* jest now reports the number of tests that were run instead of the number of
  test files.
* Added a `--json` option to print test results as JSON.
* Changed the preprocessor API. A preprocessor now receives the script, file and
  config. The cache key function receives the script, file and stringified
  config to be able to create consistent hashes.
* Removed node-worker-pool in favor of node-worker-farm (#540).
* `toEqual` now also checks the internal class name of an object. This fixes
  invalid tests like `expect([]).toEqual({})` which were previously passing.
* Added the option to provide map modules to stub modules by providing the
  `moduleNameMapper` config option.
* Allow to specify a custom `testRunner` in the configuration (#531).
* Added a `--no-cache` option to make it easier to debug preprocessor scripts.
* Fix code coverage on windows (#499).

## 0.5.6

* Cache test run performance and run slowest tests first to maximize worker
  utilization
* Update to jsdom 6.5.0

## 0.5.5

* Improve failure stack traces.
* Fix syntax error reporting.
* Add `--watch` option (#472).

## 0.5.2

* Fixed a bug with syntax errors in test files (#487).

* Upgraded node-worker-pool to 3.0.0, use the native `Promise` implementation.
* `testURL` can be used to set the location of the jsdom environment.
* Updated all of jest's dependencies, now using jsdom 6.3.
* jest now uses the native `Promise` implementation.

* Moved preprocessor cache into the haste cache directory.

* Added `--noStackTrace` option to disable stack traces.
* Jest now only works with iojs v2 and up. If you are still using node we
  recommend upgrading to iojs or keep using jest 0.4.0.
* Upgraded to jsdom 6.1.0 and removed all the custom jsdom overwrites.

## <=0.4.0

* See commit history for changes in previous versions of jest.
